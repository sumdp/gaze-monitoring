# gaze-monitoring

This is a working prototype of a gaze detection module inspired by my Tesla's attention monitoring. The goal is to implement this into the Intramotev controller app as a much-improved vigilance detection to replace random tapping, which is what it currently is, into a more robust and less obstrusive modality. This should actually increase the safety of the system and move us away from the safety paradox where a system designed to ensure attentiveness can sometimes lead to less safe workarounds. (The current state.)
